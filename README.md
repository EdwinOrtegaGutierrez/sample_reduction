# sample_reduction
This GitHub repo uses sample reduction to decrease the size of the dataset used in a k-nearest neighbors model while maintaining accuracy. A representative random subset is selected, reducing the computational time needed for classifying new instances. It's important to select the subset carefully to maintain accuracy.
